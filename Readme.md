Advantages:

Actors can represent different user personas, allowing tests to be written from multiple perspectives
Encapsulation of test data and context makes tests more modular and easier to manage and reuse
Actors can perform specific actions in a test scenario, making test code more readable and easier to maintain
Isolation of test scenarios reduces the risk of test failures caused by interactions between different scenarios
Actors can help to implement complex scenarios, allowing tests to be written at a higher level of abstraction
Test code can be more maintainable, scalable, and reusable by reducing duplication and making it easier to refactor and update

Disadvantages:

Increased complexity can make test code harder to understand and maintain
Actors can introduce additional overhead in terms of memory and CPU usage
Actors may not be well-suited for testing low-level details or more complex scenarios involving multiple interactions with the application
Poorly implemented Actors can introduce test fragility and make tests more brittle
Using Actors may require additional learning and training for team members who are not familiar with the concept
Debugging can be more difficult when using Actors due to the additional layers of abstraction
